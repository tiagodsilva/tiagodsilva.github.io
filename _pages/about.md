I am a PhD candidate at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) working on (probabilistic) machine learning and advised by [Prof. Diego Mesquita](https://weakly-informative.github.io/). I also hold a BSc degree on Data Science from the same institution. My research interests span (approximate) Bayesian inference, sampling, and statistical learning theory. Most of my recent work has focused on Generative Flow Networks ([GFlowNets](https://yoshuabengio.org/2022/03/05/generative-flow-networks/)).

In the fall of 2024, I was a visiting researcher in the Probabilistic Machine Learning (PML) group at [Aalto University](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) under the supervision of [Prof. Vikas Garg](https://www.mit.edu/~vgarg/) and [Prof. Sami Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/). There, I worked on the (efficient) assessment of and (PAC-Bayesian) statistical guarantees for GFlowNets.

I will defend my thesis on December 2024. I am **currently seeking** post-doc positions starting in 2025.
