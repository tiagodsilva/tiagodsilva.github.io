I am a first-year applied mathematics MSc student at the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) working on (probabilistic) machine learning. I am broadly interested in statistical learning theory, (approximate) Bayesian inference, and sampling. Most of my recent work has been devoted to Generative Flow Networks.
