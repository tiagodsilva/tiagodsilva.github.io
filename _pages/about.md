I am a researcher working in [Salem Lahlou](https://lahlou.org/)'s group at [MBZUAI](http://mbzuai.ac.ae/). Prior to this, I obtained my PhD degree in Applied Mathematics from the [School of Applied Mathematics](https://emap.fgv.br/en) of the [Getulio Vargas Foundation](https://fgv.br/en) (FGV) under the supervision of [Diego Mesquita](https://weakly-informative.github.io/). I also hold a BSc and MSc degrees in Data Science from the same institution.
During my PhD, I worked on (large-scale) amortized inference and statistical learning theory, with a special focus on [GFlowNets](https://yoshuabengio.org/2022/03/05/generative-flow-networks/).

In between my PhD and my current role, I worked on pricing and risk management projects as a data scientist and engineer.

<!--
In the Summer of 2024, I was a visiting researcher in the Probabilistic Machine Learning (PML) group at [Aalto University](https://research.cs.aalto.fi/pml/) under [Prof. Vikas Garg](https://www.mit.edu/~vgarg/) and [Prof. Sami Kaski](https://kaski-lab.com/).
There, I developed (efficient) assessment techniques and (PAC-Bayesian) statistical guarantees for GFlowNets.-->

Research-wise, I am broadly interested in approximate statistical inference and (Bayesian) learning theory.
