description: Collection of timeless truths about me (and some nice things).
---

I was born in the beautiful island of [Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Florian%C3%B3polis,+SC,+Brasil/@-27.5705976,-48.7999297,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x9527394eb2c632d7:0x81bc550b6a04c746!8m2!3d-27.5968578!4d-48.5468118!16s%2Fg%2F11bc6xlppd?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

I have a (twin) brother, [Diego](/assets/img/diego.jpg).

At 18, I left Florianópolis to live and study in [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rio+de+Janeiro,+RJ,+Brasil/@-22.9131581,-43.7756356,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x9bde559108a05b:0x50dc426c672fd24e!8m2!3d-22.9068467!4d-43.1728965!16zL20vMDZnbXI?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), where I ended up getting my bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in applied mathematics.

That is it (for timeless truths). Birth, taxes, and death are the only certainties in life (Franklin forgot about birth). [SCNR](http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/S/SCNR.html).
