description: Collection of timeless truths about me.
---

I was born in the beautiful island of [Florianópolis, Santa Catarina, Brazil](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Florian%C3%B3polis,+SC,+Brasil/@-27.5705976,-48.7999297,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x9527394eb2c632d7:0x81bc550b6a04c746!8m2!3d-27.5968578!4d-48.5468118!16s%2Fg%2F11bc6xlppd?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D).

I have a twin brother, [Diego](/assets/img/diego.jpg).

When I was 18 years old, I left Florianópolis to live and study in [Rio de Janeiro](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Rio+de+Janeiro,+RJ,+Brasil/@-22.9131581,-43.7756356,10z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x9bde559108a05b:0x50dc426c672fd24e!8m2!3d-22.9068467!4d-43.1728965!16zL20vMDZnbXI?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTEyMy4xIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D), where I ended up getting my bachelor's, master's, and doctoral degrees in applied mathematics.

And I think this sums up this collection; birth, taxes, and death are the only certainties in life (Franklin forgot about birth).
